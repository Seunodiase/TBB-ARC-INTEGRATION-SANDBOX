					<description><![CDATA[Petersburg records thin win against Glennallen 45-38]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pins and needles were part of the price of admission as Petersburg nipped Glennallen 45-38 on Dec. 16 in Alaska girls high school basketball.</p>
<p>The Panthers authored a promising start, taking advantage of the Vikings 11-10 at the end of the first quarter.</p>
<p>Had this been a prize fight, the Panthers would&#8217;ve earned the judge&#8217;s decision at halftime, with a 17-14 lead on the Vikings.</p>
<p>The Vikings broke in front at the beginning of the fourth quarter with a 27-26 lead over the Panthers.</p>
<p>The clock was the only thing that stopped Petersburg, which enjoyed the upper hand in an 18-12 fourth quarter, too.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Valdez squeezes past Petersburg 41-36]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mighty close, mighty fine, Valdez wore a victory shine after clipping Petersburg 41-36 for an Alaska girls basketball victory on Dec. 28.</p>
<p>Valdez opened with a 12-7 advantage over Petersburg through the first quarter.</p>
<p>The Buccaneers kept a 24-21 intermission margin at the Vikings&#8217; expense.</p>
<p>Valdez breathed fire to a 39-24 bulge over Petersburg as the fourth quarter began.</p>
<p>Petersburg rallied in the final quarter, but Valdez skirted trouble with just enough offense to thwart all hopes.</p>
